<h1><font color="#FF0000">The Waterloo Wellington Science Fair</font></h1>
<p>Each year, schools around the region participate in this annual science fair. 
  Forest Heights has often sent 5-10 students to compete in the senior and intermediate 
  divisions and we have often done very well. Last year we had a student compete 
  in the Canada Wide science fair and the individual attained a bronze medal (third 
  in Canada, only <u>two</u> other students were better). If you are interested 
  in competing Mr. White needs to see you. I will need a name and an email address. 
  Most successful projects are based on experimentation, although there are two 
  other categories: engineering and research. Most project will need to be started 
  fairly early in the school year since the science fair competition occurs in 
  April.</p>
