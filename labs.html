<h3><u>Informal</u></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Title- Make sure it is very descriptive</li>
  <li>Purpose- A purpose provides a question that you feel needs to answered, an
    educated guess as to what you think may happen, and reasons for why you
    would be doing the experiment</li>
  <li>Results- Complete all necessary recordings of data.&nbsp; Provide an
    informative way of presentation: Graphs, Table, etc</li>
  <li>Discussion- Answer the questions completely in the discussion section of
    the lab sheet.</li>
</ol>
<h3><u>Formal</u></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Title- Make sure it is very descriptive</li>
  <li>Introduction-This is where information that is already known about the
    subject is placed.&nbsp; It includes past reseach and a description of the
    subject that is being used in the experiment</li>
  <li>Purpose- A purpose provides a question that you feel needs to answered, an
    educated guess as to what you think may happen, and reasons for why you
    would be doing the experiment</li>
  <li>Materials- Please list the materials you used (from the lab sheet)</li>
  <li>Procedure- Reference the lab sheet and make sure to include any changes 
    in the procedure.</li>
  <li>Observation- Includes the data you collected and any additional
    information you felt was important when the lab started or during the
    experiment.</li>
  <li>Results- Complete all tables and necessary graphs.&nbsp; All calculations
    should be as neat and complete.&nbsp; A ruler is important to provide
    neatness.</li>
  <li>Discussion- Answer the questions completely in the discussion section of
    the lab sheet.</li>
  <li>Conclusion- Answer the questions completely in the conclusion section of
    the lab sheet.</li>

<h2 align="center"><u><a name="ownexp" id="ownexp"><span style="background-color: #0000FF">Design 
  your own experiment</span></a></u></h2>
<p align="center">Write a formal lab report for an experiment. The experiment 
  is thought out and planned but it does not need to be performed. It will use 
  fictitious data that you provide to mimic a real experiment.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This assignment will demonstrate the understanding of the components of a standard 
  formal lab report as well as the understanding of the different types of variables 
  involved in an experiment.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>2-3 sheets of paper and your imagination</p>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Your formal lab report should contain the following:</p>
<p> A. Problem - A short description of the reasoning behind the selection of 
  your topic as well as the question you are trying to answer. </p>
<p>B. Hypothesis - Try to use &quot;If…then…&quot; statements but make sure you 
  are giving a prediction of how the questioned will be answered.</p>
<p> C. Materials - Short list of the stuff you think you will need. </p>
<p>D. Procedure - Describe how the experiment would have been performed. Identify 
  the independent, dependent and two controlled variables.</p>
<p> E. Observations (Results) - Provide a table/graph for your results. Provide 
  a qualitative statement and a quantitative statement. (Fully label, use a ruler, 
  provide a title)</p>
<p> F. Conclusion - Compare your results with your problem and your hypothesis. 
  Provide the most important finding.</p>
<p> G. Sources of Error - Describe two sources of error that may affect your experiment 
  and general human error does not count</p>
<p> H. Discussion - Where can you see this type of research going? Provide the 
  next logical step; identify what experiment you would perform.</p>
<h3>Remember this is to show understanding of a formal lab report. Pen or typed 
  reports only.</h3>
