            <p>So far you have studied some of the structures of biological molecules.  You have studied the cell and how these molecules are involved in cell structure.  You will now look at a very important class of molecules called enzymes.  You will study how they work as biological catalysts.  You will also have the opportunity to see how enzymes are important in foods. </p>
