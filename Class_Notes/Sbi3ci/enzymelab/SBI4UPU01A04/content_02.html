		<p><strong>Enzyme  Regulation</strong></p>

		<p>Enzyme activity needs to be controlled by  the cell. This prevents the unwanted accumulation of substrates and products.   One method for controlling enzyme activity  is through the allosteric site.  The  substance that binds to the allosteric site is often a product/substrate.  For example, when the cell needs a particular  product made, the substrate or a precursor to the substrate can activate the  enzyme by binding to the allosteric site and turning the enzyme “on”.  The cell can also “turn off” the enzyme by  having the product molecule bind to the allosteric site, thus giving the enzyme  feedback when there are high concentrations of product.  This is called feedback inhibition.</p>

		<p>Non-protein substances such as coenzymes  (organic molecules) and cofactors (inorganic ions) work with an enzyme to help  the enzyme function.  Many vitamins from  your diet work as coenzymes.  Many of the  minerals form your diet work as cofactors.  </p>

            <td valign="top"><p><strong>Inhibition</strong></p>

            <p>Enzymes  can be inhibited in several ways.  The  two general methods of inhibiting an enzyme is through competitive and non-competitive  inhibition.  In competitive inhibition,  another molecule, other than the substrate, competes for the active site of the  enzyme. When the substrate concentration increases, more substrate molecules are  available to compete for the active site and overcome competitive inhibition.</p></td>

            <td valign="top">In non-competitive  inhibition, the inhibitor (shown to the left) fits into another enzyme site  other than the active site. In this case the shape of the enzyme is  altered.  Once the shape is changed, the  substrate no longer fits into the active site and the enzyme cannot catalyze  the reaction.  Adding more substrate will  not affect this type of inhibition.  The  inhibitor molecule may release the allosteric site, making this type of  inhibition reversible as in the case of allosteric regulation.  However if the inhibitor binds permanently or  permanently alters the shape of the enzyme, it is termed non-reversible  inhibition.</td>
