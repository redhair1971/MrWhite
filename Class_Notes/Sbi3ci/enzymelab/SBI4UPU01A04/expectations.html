                <strong>Overall Expectations:</strong>

            </p>

          <p><strong>SIV.01</strong> demonstrate scientific investigation skills (related to both inquiry and  research) in the four areas of skills (initiating and planning, performing and  recording, analysing and interpreting, and communicating);<br>

            <strong>BCV.02</strong> investigate the chemical  structures, functions, and chemical properties of biological molecules involved  in some common cellular processes and biochemical reactions;<br>

            <strong>BCV.03</strong> demonstrate an understanding of the  structures and functions of biological molecules, and the biochemical reactions  required to maintain normal cellular function. </p>

            <p><strong>Specific Expectations: </strong></p>

            <p><strong>SI1.06</strong> compile accurate data from laboratory and other sources, and organize and  record the data, using appropriate formats, including tables, flow charts,  graphs, and/or diagrams;<br>

              <strong>SI1.08</strong> synthesize, analyse, interpret, and evaluate qualitative and/or quantitative  data to determine whether the evidence supports or refutes the initial  prediction or hypothesis and whether it is consistent with scientific theory;  identify sources of bias and/or error; and suggest improvements to the inquiry  to reduce the likelihood of error;<br>

              <strong>SI1.11</strong> communicate ideas, plans, procedures, results, and conclusions orally, in  writing, and/or in electronic presentations, using appropriate language and a  variety of formats (e.g., data tables, laboratory reports, presentations,  debates, simulations, models);<br>

              <strong>SI1.12</strong> use appropriate numeric, symbolic, and graphic modes of representation (e.g.,  biological diagrams, Punnett square), and appropriate units of measurement;  (e.g., SI and imperial units);<br>

              <strong>BC2.05 </strong>plan and conduct an investigation related to a cellular process (e.g., factors that affect enzyme activity; factors that affect transport of substances across cell membranes) using appropriate laboratory equipment andtechniques, and report the results in an approprate format [IP, PR, C]; <br>

              <strong>BC3.04</strong> describe the chemical structures  and mechanisms of various enzymes.</p>
