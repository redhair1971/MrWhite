        <p>In addition to playing a role in cell  structures, proteins have an important biological role as biological  catalysts.  <br>

 <br>

<strong>Enzymes</strong></p>

        <p>Enzymes are protein molecules that act as  biological catalysts.  A catalyst is a  substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being used up itself in  the process.  A catalyst can be used over  and over again to speed up the same reaction.   Catalysts work by providing a surface to break the bonds between the  reactant molecules and rearrange atoms in order to create bonds to form the products.  With no catalyst, reactant molecules must  collide with enough energy and the correct orientation in order to break the bonds.  The energy required to break these bonds is  called the activation energy.  The  activation energy is the amount of energy needed to reach a state where  reactant bonds are breaking and product bonds are forming.  This state is called the transition state.  Not all the reactant molecules have enough  energy to reach the transition state or the correct orientation upon collision.  As a result, molecules can keep colliding with little force and there will be  no change into products.  One way to  improve the rate of a chemical reaction is to increase the temperature.  This will give each molecule more energy and  increase the number of collisions as well as the force of collision and  increase the likelihood of reactant bonds breaking and reaching the transition state.  This can be done in a laboratory, but not in  living systems where organisms are made of proteins that will denature upon  heating.</p>

            <td valign="top"> The red line in the diagram shows the energy level of the reactants and the energy level of the products of an uncatalyzed reaction.  The highest point on the curve is the transition state.  This is where the reactant bonds are breaking and product bonds are forming.  At this point the molecules are neither reactants nor products, but are referred to as the activated complex.  The blue line shows the same reaction, but this time with an enzyme.  The enzyme does not change the energy of the products or the reactants, but works by lowering the activation energy (EA). Note that the energy required to reach the transition state is decreased and now more molecules may have the energy required to form the activated complex and be converted into products.  </td>

        </table>

        <p>In this particular reaction (above) the products have a lower energy than the reactants.  When the products have a lower energy level, this is called an exergonic reaction.  In an exergonic reaction the products have less free energy than that of the reactants and energy is given off from the system.  When the reverse is true and the products have a higher energy than the reactants, then it is an endergonic reaction and the system requires energy.  Endergonic reactions will not be spontaneous, but will require energy to be invested in the products.</p>

        <p>When referring to enzymes, reactant molecules  are called substrates.  In the above  diagram, the enzyme is in gray and provides a surface for the reactant to fit  into and form products. In Fig.1, the active site/cleft of the enzyme is  visible.  This is where the substrate  fits into the enzyme perfectly.  The  specificity (of fit) is referred to the Lock-Key Model of enzymes where every  substrate (key) fits perfectly into an enzyme (lock). Therefore, there are many  enzymes to catalyze all the different reactions and they are specific to each  substrate.  Note in Fig.2 and Fig.3, the  activated complex is formed where a substrate is converted into products.  The enzyme remains unchanged and can pick up  another substrate molecule.</p>

        <p><strong>How  can proteins do this?</strong></p>

            <td valign="top">Proteins  have a globular structure which is not rigid.   Look at the enzyme to the right.   This is an enzyme called lipase.   This diagram shows the 2-D structure of the alpha helix (which look like  green pencils here) and the beta pleated sheets (which look like sticks  here).  The globular structure is  flexible and can often change shape.  It  may have an allosteric site which is a site separate from the active site. When  a substance binds to the allosteric site, the enzyme increases or decreases the  productivity of the enzyme.  This is  shown in the diagram below.  The  substrate binds to the activate site, but the pink and orange molecules bind to  the allosteric site.  This is one way to  control an enzyme, activate it or shut it down, by having another molecule bind  to the allosteric site to regulate its activity.</td>
