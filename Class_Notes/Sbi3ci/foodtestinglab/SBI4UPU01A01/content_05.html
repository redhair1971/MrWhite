        <p><strong>Nucleic  Acids</strong></p>

		<p>The two main types of nucleic acids are DNA and RNA.   DNA is the molecule that  provides the genetic instructions that are found in each cell in your  body.  RNA is similar in structure but is  involved in making proteins for the body.</p>

		<p><strong>DNA</strong><strong> Structure</strong></p>

		<p>DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.   DNA carries hereditary  information that is passed on from one generation to the next.  It is found in all organisms – from bacteria  to plants to mammals.  It holds the  chemical message for producing every part of the organism.  It regulates life by carrying the directions  for growth, repair and replacement of cells and their parts.  Let’s look at DNA  in more detail. </p>

            <td valign="top"><p align="left">DNA is the genetic material that carries all the  instructions to make an individual.  It  is found in the nucleus of every cell in the body.  DNA  carries the instruction to make everything about you – your proteins, hair  colour, eye colour, etc.  There are a lot  of instructions, so in order for all the information to fit, DNA is packaged tightly in the cell in the form of  chromatin.  However, when it is unwound  and stretched out, it looks like a ladder that has been twisted.  This structure is called the DNA double helix.</p>            </td>

		<p><strong>Nucleotides</strong></p>

		<p>DNA is a polymer made up of repeating  monomer units called nucleotides.  A  nucleotide consists of a five carbon sugar (ribose), a nitrogen base, and a  phosphate group. There are 4 nitrogen bases that exist in DNA.  The  bases are either purines or pyrimidines. Purines include guanine and adenosine.  Pyrimidines include cytosine and thymine.</p>

            <td valign="middle"><p align="left">These nitrogen bases are found facing the middle and form the rungs of the DNA ladder.  The sugar (pentose) and phosphate groups make up the sides of the ladder.  The sides of the ladder are referred to as the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA double helix.  Each nucleotide is attached to the next nucleotide through the sugar-phosphate backbone by a hydrolysis reaction forming a phosphodiester linkage. The blue circles indicate the phosphate groups attached to the five carbon ring ribose structure.</p></td>

          <tr valign="middle">

            <td valign="middle"><p align="left">To recap, the sugar-phosphate backbone makes the sides of the ladder and the rungs are made of the 4 nitrogenous bases.  Their names are often represented by the letter of name (A, C, G, &amp; T).  The actual ladder itself is made of two strands of DNA which is why it is called a double helix.  Each strand attaches by the nitrogen bases that pair in the middle (the rungs of the ladder).  The nitrogenous bases are held together by H-bonds in the middle of the ladder.</p>

              <p align="left"><strong><em>A pairs with T – held by 2 H-bonds</em></strong><br>

                  <strong><em>G pairs with C – held by 3 H-bonds</em></strong></p>

              <p align="left">Note that a purine pairs with a pyrimidine forming H-bonds with amino, and carbonyl functional groups.<br>

  The pairing of bases holds the two DNA strands together – and the two halves of the ladders together. Notice that on each strand of DNA there is a 3’end and a 5’end.  The 3’ refers to the carbon 3 on the ribose that is free and not linked to another nucleotide.  The 5’ refers to carbon 5 on the ribose that is not linked to another nucleotide.  Note that the 3’ end of one strand is opposite to the 5’end of the other strand of DNA.</p></td>

            RNA differs from DNA in that it is single stranded.  It has a hydroxyl group on carbon 2 of the ribose sugar while DNA does not.  Also RNA does not contain the pyrimidine thymine. Thymine is replaced by another pyrimidine - uracil in its structure.  RNA molecules are important in protein synthesis. </td>
