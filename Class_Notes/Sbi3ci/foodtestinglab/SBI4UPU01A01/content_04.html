        <p>Now let’s put together everything you have  learned so far and study biological molecules.   These molecules are often termed macromolecules and make up most of the  structural and functional components of living things.</p>

		<p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong></p>

		<p>You consume carbohydrates everyday, usually  in large amounts to provide your body with energy.</p>

          <tr valign="middle">

		  <td valign="middle"><p><strong>Monosaccharides</strong></p>

		  The simplest  carbohydrates are called monosaccharides or simple sugars.  The following is the structure of  glucose.  Glucose can exist in a linear  chain as shown or a ring structure shown beside.  Glucose is carried in the blood and  transported to the cells to make cellular energy</td>

              The primary sequence of a protein can be folded on  itself forming two visible secondary structures called an alpha helix or a beta  pleated sheet.  These structures are held  together by hydrogen bonds.  The next  level of complexity is the tertiary structure.   This is a 3-dimensional globular structure held together by interactions  between amino acids, hydrogen bonds, and disulphide linkages.  Some proteins are made of more than one amino  acid chain or primary structure.  When  the different chains come together, they form a quaternary structure also held  together by interactions between amino acids, hydrogen bonds, and disulphide  linkages.  A functional protein depends  on its 3-dimensional structure. If the structure is damaged or altered, this  may affect the function of the protein.</td>

		<p><strong>Fats</strong></p>

		<p>Fats  are molecules that do not like water.  Molecules  that do not mix with water are said to be hydrophobic. There are various types of fats such as  triglycerides, phospholipids and steroids.</p>

            <td valign="middle"><p><strong>Triglycerides</strong></p>

              These are fats that are made of glycerol and three  molecules of fatty acid.  Fatty acids are  long hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl group on the end to make an acid.  Fatty acids can vary in length and saturation  (meaning the number of C-C double bonds).   Each hydroxyl group of the glycerol can connect to a fatty acid through  an esterification reaction.  This is seen  below.</td>

          <tr valign="middle">

            <td valign="middle"><p><strong>Steroids</strong></p>

              <p>Steroids  are fats that are based on the structure of cholesterol.  Cholesterol is important in the structure of  cell membranes and in the synthesis of many hormones in the body such as  testosterone, estrogen, aldosterone, and more.   When cholesterol levels are high in the blood, this can lead to  arthrosclerosis.</p>

              <p><strong>Phospholipids</strong></p>

              Phospholipids are the last type of fat you will study.  They are very important in the structure of cell membranes.  Phospholipids are similar in structure to  triglycerides, but one fatty acid is replaced by a highly polar phosphate  group.  This makes this end of the fat  attracted to water or water-loving which is referred to as hydrophilic.</td>
