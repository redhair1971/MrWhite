        <p><strong>Biological  Reactions</strong></p>

		<p>There tends to be patterns in the way that  biological molecules react. Learning some of the basic reactions that occur in  biological systems is important to understanding biochemistry. </p>

		<p><strong>Neutralization  Reaction</strong></p>

		<p>This type of reaction is between an acid  and a base.  The simplest and easiest  type of neutralization is when a molecule of water is removed and a salt is  formed.   </p>

		<p>Mg(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>   +     HCl    <img src="images/Arrow1_wht.gif" alt="arrow" width="14" height="12">    MgCl<span class="subscript">2</span> +      HOH<br>

	  base        +     acid    <img src="images/Arrow1_wht.gif" alt="arrow" width="14" height="12">    salt      +    water                                                        </p>

		<p>In the above reaction, hydrochloric acid  (or stomach acid) is neutralized by magnesium hydroxide (found in antacids) to  make a salt (magnesium chloride) and water.   This reaction is how substances such as “Milk of Magnesia” work in order  to reduce heartburn which is caused by stomach acid.</p>

		<p><strong>Condensation  Reaction</strong></p>

		<p>There are many types of condensation  reactions.  The general concept here is  that two small molecules come together (or condense) to form a large molecule.  In this process, atoms are removed when two  small molecules join together to make 1 big molecule. Condensation  reactions are how synthetic and natural polymers are formed.  The example below shows how a strong  synthetic polymer, called Kevlar, is formed from its monomers, 1,4 –  pheylene-diamine and terephthaloyl chloride.		</p>

            <td valign="middle" class="center"><p align="left">In  this condensation reaction, H and Cl are removed to connect the two molecules together.  This process is repeated thousands of times  in order to make Kevlar. Because Kevlar is made from many of the same molecules  joined together, it is called a polymer. The individual repeating units in the  polymer are called monomers. </p>            </td>

              <td>Kevlar is used to make bullet-proof vests. The bonds formed in the above  reaction are very strong. In addition, the long molecules formed in the above  polymerization can react with each other to form very strong cross-links. For  this reason, Kevlar is said to be 5 times stronger than steel on a gram per  gram basis.  </td>

		<p><strong>Hydrolysis  Reactions</strong></p>

		<p>Hydrolysis reactions are the opposite of  dehydration reactions.  The concept here  is to cut (or lyse) a large molecule into smaller molecules using water.  This is a very important reaction in living  systems.  This is how your body breaks  down fats, proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and many other substances.</p>

		<p><strong>Redox Reactions</strong></p>

		<p>Redox  reactions are also known as oxidation-reduction reactions. In living systems,  redox reactions often involve the transfer of free energy from one molecule to  another.  Oxidation is when an atom or  molecule loses electrons and reduction is when an atom or molecule gains  electrons.  A molecule that loses the  electron is said to be oxidized.  A molecule  that gains the electron is said to be reduced.  However, in biology, molecules are large and  one can not count the number of electrons within a molecule. A simpler way to  identify a redox reaction is when a hydrogen atom is lost /gained, or an oxygen  atom is lost /gained. When an oxygen atom is lost or a hydrogen atom is gained,  reduction occurs. When an oxygen atom is gained or a hydrogen atom is lost,  that molecule is said to be oxidized.  </p>

		<blockquote>

		  <p>Oxidation  =  lose an e-, remove a  hydrogen atom or add an oxygen atom<br>

		    Reduction  =  gain an e-, add a hydrogen  atom or remove an oxygen atom</p>
