<h1>Grade 10 Applied: The Human Impact on Food Chains</h1>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p> Firstly to introduce of the term &quot;indicator species&quot; as a method 
  of the health of an ecosysytem. Secondly to understand the differences between 
  levels of concern of various at risk species around the world.</p>

<h2>Part 1: The Indicator species</h2>
<p>What is an indicator species?</p>
<p>Provide an example of an indicator species in one of Canada's ecosystems, where 
  is it generally found in Canada and describe its role in its ecosystem</p>
<h2>Disappearing frogs</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Why is the population of amphibians such a large concern for biologists 
    around the world?</li>
  <li> List the potential reasons why frog populations have been declining and 
    provide a reason why it is affecting the frogs.</li>
  <li> On page 9 how has the role of the frog changed between the two different 
    food chains?</li>
  <li> Why does the skin of a frog make frogs good indicators of the health of 
    local ecosystems?<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 2: At Risk Species: &quot;Going, going, gone...&quot;</h2>
<ol>
  <li>There are several different terms that may describe an at risk organism. 
    Create a table that includes all the different terms and their definition.</li>
  <li>How can the extinction of one species have a serious effect on other organisms 
    in the ecosystem?</li>
  <li>Why is biodiversity important for ecosystems?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 3: Research paper</h2>
<p>Find a list of Endangered Animals on the planet.<br>
  Pick one animal and write a small information paper about it.<br>
  Add the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pictures</li>
  <li>Description</li>
  <li>Habitat</li>
  <li>Role or niche in the ecosystem</li>
  <li>Life cycle</li>
  <li>How have humans impacted this organism</li>
  <li>Plans for fixing the problem</li>
</ul>
